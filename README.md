# eRunner-Mobile-Application

The primary objective of this study was to design and implement a relational database that is industry ready for a mobile application. Due to the recent pandemic, the world has come to a stop and slowly reopening. Many sports related events have been either postponed or cancelled due to social distancing. Since people are staying home, this is affecting their fitness and this led us to the idea to build a real time platform for runners to compete with one or more players located anywhere in the world! The goal was to create, alter tables and maintain data of multiple entities to support different functionalities of the mobile application in the live environment. Also, manage insertion, update, and delete of the data for storage and efficient retrieval of the data of the mobile application. Additionally, integrate GPS coordinates and user profile pictures with User Interface to track time, speed and distance and finally develop an interactive and user friendly user interface for easy utilization of mobile applications. 

The goal of the study is to build a database model which can handle data of the live platform which facilitates racing, marathon and training. Database can efficiently store information of each user, logs of their matches, list of marathons and users’ enrollment in the marathon. Apart from it it should be accurate because the result of the match will be decided from data stored in the database and also it will help to identify players’ performance parameters like percentage win, total distance, stamina, level and other parameters. These parameters are useful for players to track their performance anso useful to identify opponents in the quick match.
